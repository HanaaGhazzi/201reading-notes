# Images, Color and Text 

## Images
_Images can be easily inserted at any section in an HTML page._

_To insert image in an HTML page, use the <img> tags. It is an empty tag, containing only attributes since the closing tag is not required._

_Just keep in mind that you should use the __<img>__ tag inside __<body>â€¦</body>__ tag. The src attribute is used to add the image source i.e. URL of the image. The alt attribute is for adding alternate text, width for adding width, and height for adding the height of the image._

**Setting the Width and Height of an Image**
- The _width_ and _height_ attributes are used to specify the width and height of an image.

- You can also use the _style_ attribute to specify width and height for the images. It prevents style sheets from changing the image size accidently, since inline style has the highest priority.

## Color

_Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker._

-  Hue always refers to the base color.
- Saturation is how pure the hue is.
- Lightness (or brightness) is the amount of white or black mixed in with the color.

## Text 

#### Typeface Terminology

- **Serif** : Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.

- **Sans-Serif** : Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.


- **Monospace** :Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts
have different widths.)
