# HTML, CSS AND JS 

### HTML Formatting Elements

- <b> - Bold text
- <strong> - Important text
- <i> - Italic text
- <em> - Emphasized text
- <mark> - Marked text
- <small> - Smaller text
- <del> - Deleted text
- <ins> - Inserted text

### CSS 

__A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:__

1. The selector points to the HTML element to style (h1).

2. The declaration block (in curly braces) contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

3. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

4. In the following example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, red and have a font size of 32 pixels:

<style>
p {
    font-size: 32px;
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}
</style>

### JS 

_A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.Statements should end with a semicolon._

**JavaScript Variable**
> Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.

> JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.


**JavaScript Data Types**

_Data type indicates characteristics of data. It tells the compiler whether the data value is numeric, alphabetic, date etc., so that it can perform the appropriate operation._
