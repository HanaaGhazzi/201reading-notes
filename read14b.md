# What Google Learned About the Perfect Team

> “We had lots of data, but nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or
backgrounds made any difference."

> "The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter,” according to Abeer Dubey, a manager
in Google’s People Analytics division

The article profiles a 25-year-old Yale School of Management student, Julia Rozovsky, who
participated in two study groups, hoping to find one she enjoyed. She found that both groups
had people who were bright and outgoing. However, one group had people jockeying for
leadership positions, criticizing one another’s ideas, and experiencing conflicts around who
was in charge. The other group was quite different – it was warm and friendly.
According to a study published in the Harvard Business Review:

With businesses becoming more global and complex, employees are spending a majority of
their day communicating in teams.

Yet there has been little agreement, until now, on exactly what distinguishes the high
functioning teams from the rest.

In 2012, Google launched Project Aristotle – a quest to build the perfect team. They studied
180 teams to figure out why some faltered and others succeeded. They found no evidence that
the composition of the team was influential in the outcomes. What they found was this:

**psychological safety** was clearly vital to a team’s success. This includes “equality in
distribution of conversational turn-taking” and “average social sensitivity” (which means
being intuitive to expressions, tone of voice and other nonverbal clues).

**Bottom line:** What mattered was a feeling – the feeling of being safe. Members of a team
perform best when they feel safe. Feeling safe is about having equal time to talk. This means
not feeling stunted, cut off, or criticized about what you have to say when you choose to
speak up in front of the team.


Google’s researchers concluded that it is not a matter of whether people are competitive or
analytical, introverted or extroverted, etc., but that they are happiest in teams where they feel
safe. Feeling safe is the secret ingredient to a team’s success.
