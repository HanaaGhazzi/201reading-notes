### CSS boxes 

__The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content__

**The display: inline-block Value**
> Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

> Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

> Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

### FOR ,Do/While (LOOPS)

_The do/while statement creates a loop that executes a block of code once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true._

_The do/while statement is used when you want to run a loop at least one time, no matter what._

**JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:**

- for - loops through a block of code a number of times
- for/in - loops through the properties of an object
- for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- do/while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true
