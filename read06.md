# OBJECT & DOM !


### WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

**Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.**

- *IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES*
- *IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS*

### DOM
**The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.**


> A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

 the Document Object Model identifies:

- the interfaces and objects used to represent and manipulate a document
- the semantics of these interfaces and objects - including both behavior and attributes
- the relationships and collaborations among these interfaces and objects
